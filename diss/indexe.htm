			<h2>1. Relevance of the Topic</h2>

			<p>
			Digital transformation of organizations is a strategic imperative in the modern economy, determining competitiveness, adaptability, and resilience in a turbulent external environment. However, the transition from recognizing the need for change to its successful implementation is fraught with significant methodological and managerial challenges. The key problems are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Subjectivity in decision-making, based on intuition and limited experience, leading to fragmented and uncoordinated initiatives.</li>
				<li>Difficulty in accounting for multi-criteria nature and interdependencies between technological, process, personnel, and financial factors.</li>
				<li>Lack of predictive modeling tools that can assess the risks and return on investment for transformation scenarios.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Statistics show that users make typos in 10–15% of cases, with context playing a key role in correct correction in 26% of cases.
				 In search engines, for example, errors can lead to irrelevant results or a lack of responses.
				In professional fields (scientific articles, legal documents), spelling accuracy is critical for preserving legal validity and information reliability. </p>

			<p>The master's thesis consists of four sections, introduction, conclusion, and list of references.</p>

			<p>The introduction substantiates the relevance of developing intelligent spelling check systems capable of considering context, unlike traditional dictionary methods.

			<p>The first section presents a theoretical investigation of the problem of context-dependent text correction. It begins with an overview of the evolution of spelling check systems:
				 from simple dictionary comparisons and statistical n-gram models to modern neural network approaches. The main emphasis is on analyzing the capabilities and limitations of Language Models (LM), particularly transformer architectures (BERT, GPT, their derivatives), for error detection and correction tasks.
				  Based on this analysis, functional and non-functional requirements for the system are formed, such as accuracy in recognizing contextual errors (omission/commission), processing speed, and support for subject domains.</p>
			<p>The second section describes the technology stack required for system implementation.</p>
			<p>The third section details the system development and training process.</p>
			<p>The fourth section is dedicated to testing, analysis of results, and integration of the developed product.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 35px;">3.1 Key Concepts and Technologies</h3>

<p>
    Digital transformation of organizations is a comprehensive process of transitioning to new digital technologies, working methods, and business models to enhance efficiency, competitiveness, and sustainability. Key concepts in this area include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Digital Maturity</strong> — an integral indicator reflecting an organization's ability to use digital technologies to achieve strategic goals. It is assessed across a range of indicators (technical-technological, cognitive, personal).</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Transformation Roadmap</strong> — a strategic plan defining the sequence of actions, resources, timelines, and expected results for transitioning to a target digital model.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Intelligent Decision Support System (DSS)</strong> — a software complex utilizing artificial intelligence, optimization, and data analysis methods to formulate evidence-based recommendations for managing transformation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Traditional approaches to transformation planning are based on expert assessments, SWOT analysis, and project management methods, often leading to subjectivity, fragmentation, and high risks. The modern approach considered in this work is based on formal mathematical models, hybrid optimization algorithms, and ontological knowledge representation, enabling a shift from intuitive planning to data-driven management.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 35px;">3.2 Challenges in Digital Transformation</h3>

<p>
    Automating the process of forming digital transformation roadmaps is associated with a number of methodological and technical complexities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Multi-criteria Nature and Conflicting Goals:</strong> The need to simultaneously account for conflicting criteria, such as maximizing efficiency, minimizing costs, and reducing risks, requiring the application of complex multi-criteria optimization methods.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>High Degree of Uncertainty:</strong> Predicting the outcomes of transformation initiatives is linked to data incompleteness, volatility of the external environment, and subjectivity in expert assessments of parameters (maturity increase, risk level).</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Combinatorial Complexity:</strong> The task of synthesizing an optimal action sequence belongs to the class of NP-hard problems, as the number of possible combinations and permutations of transformation practices grows exponentially.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Accounting for Complex Dependencies:</strong> The need to model logical prerequisites, synergistic, and antagonistic effects between different actions in a roadmap.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Overcoming these problems requires the development of specialized hybrid algorithms capable of working with fuzzy data, as well as creating a formalized knowledge base about the subject domain.
</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 35px;">3.3 Theoretical Foundations of Context-Dependent Transformation Planning</h3>

<p>
    Historically, the task of strategic planning for digital transformation was solved using qualitative methods (brainstorming, expert sessions) and standard frameworks (e.g., TOGAF). A key drawback of this approach is the lack of a formal, reproducible procedure for selecting an optimal development path, leading to decisions heavily dependent on the experience and intuition of consultants.
</p>

<p>
    The evolution led to the application of operations research and multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and TOPSIS. These methods allow structuring the decision-making process and quantitatively comparing alternatives across several criteria. However, their capabilities are limited to the stage of evaluating ready-made options and do not solve the task of automatically *generating* these options (roadmaps) based on diagnosing the organization's current state.
</p>

<p>
    A qualitative leap is associated with the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods. The approach considered in the work is based on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Case-Based Reasoning (CBR):</strong> Using a case base (successful and unsuccessful transformation cases) to search for relevant solutions by analogy.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Hybrid Optimization:</strong> Combining metaheuristic algorithms (ant colony optimization, simulated annealing) for searching the space of possible action sequences with a formal state transition model to evaluate each candidate.</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Fuzzy Logic:</strong> A framework for working with qualitative expert assessments and uncertainty in model parameters (e.g., "high risk", "medium maturity increase").</li>
    <li style="margin-left: 50px;"><strong>Ontological Modeling:</strong> Creating a formal specification of the subject domain (ontology), which ensures semantic data consistency, defines relationships between entities (actions, resources, metrics), and serves as a basis for logical inference.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Thus, the decision support task is reformulated from a descriptive to a prescriptive one: the system not only diagnoses the current level of digital maturity but also automatically generates and ranks personalized strategies for transformation that are optimal according to the specified criteria.
