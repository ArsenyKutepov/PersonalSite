			<h1>Hobbies</h1>
			<p>My hobbies form an important layer of my personal life, allowing me to combine intellectual challenge, creative expression, and technical development. They reflect my interest in complex systems, attention to detail, and desire to improve my skills across diverse fields.</p>

<p>One of my key passions is computer gaming, which I view not just as a form of leisure, but as a space for developing strategic thinking and teamwork. I am deeply engaged with CS:GO 2: I practice regularly, analyze game mechanics, study tactics, and follow the professional scene. The experience of participating in a CS:GO 2 tournament became a significant milestone — it taught me to work under tight time constraints, make quick decisions, and collaborate effectively with a team. The competitive format exposed weaknesses in my gameplay strategy, pushing me to deliberately work on my mistakes and delve deeper into the metagame. For me, this is not just entertainment, but a way to train logic, reaction time, and the ability to adapt to changing conditions.</p>

<p>Another passion — music — demands coordination and a keen ear. Working with sound — from the vibration of a string to the modulation of a synthesizer — develops a sense of rhythm and teaches me to hear harmony in complex chords. I am mastering various techniques: from basic chords and vocal exercises to complex solos, polyphonic parts, and creating electronic timbres. Each piece is a challenge: it requires precise instrument tuning, control over pick attack dynamics, pressure on the keys, and the tonal nuances of the voice to achieve an expressive and cohesive sound. I find it particularly interesting to experiment with combining the acoustic energy of the guitar, the organic nature of vocals, and the limitless possibilities of the synthesizer. The process of rehearsing and arranging takes hours, but the final feeling, when individual parts merge into a powerful, living musical fabric, brings the deepest satisfaction. This hobby has become a form of self-expression for me: it teaches me to listen to myself, channel emotions into sound, and appreciate the moment of improvisation.</p>
